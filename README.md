# flow-ical-feed

WordPress plugin example: Calendar feeds based on custom post queries

**This plugin is not intended to be used as is!** This example is lifted straight from one of my own projects, it uses the [eluceo/iCal](https://github.com/eluceo/iCal) library to build the feed. Use this code to get an idea of how my setup works and adapt it to your own needs.
